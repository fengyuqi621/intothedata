Steps: 
1. Data cleaning: 
    a. English Speaker (engnat): Ineffective data filterâ€” both creators are non-native English speakers
        yet we can complete the questionnaire without friction. Hence drop column engnat 

    b. Drop time and position column: drop.Q#I and E

    c. Validity test: Create a new column call VCLT, that record the sum of VCL 1 - 16.
        Drop any row VCLT < 10 

    d. Drop column screen size 

    f. uniquenetworkloaction: due to data clarity we are dropping this column as this 
        column does not consider students from the same organization or institute.

    g:  Drop introelapse and surveyelapse 

    h: Match scale: (http://thetwigcentre.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dass42-questionnaire.pdf) Since we are using this score sheet 
        we are matching the current dataset score to the score sheet. 

    i: Create three new column call D score (Depression), A score (Anxiety), S score (Stress). 
        Sum the corresponding column. (Score have different severity please refer to the pdf)

    k: Export data to a new CSV file call s_dassdata.csv

Steps: 
1. Data cleaning: 
a. English Speaker (engnat): Ineffective data filterâ€” both creators are non-native English speakers yet we can complete the questionnaire without friction. Hence drop column engnat 
b. Drop time and position column: drop.Q#I and E
c. Validity test: Create a new column call VCLT, that record the sum of VCL 1 - 16. Drop any row VCLT < 10 
d. Drop column screen size 
f. uniquenetworkloaction: due to data clarity we are dropping this column as this column does not consider students from the same organization or institute.
g:  Drop introelapse and surveyelapse 

h: Match scale: (http://thetwigcentre.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dass42-questionnaire.pdf) Since we are using this score sheet we are matching the current dataset score to the score sheet. 
i: Create three new column call D score (Depression), A score (Anxiety), S score (Stress). Sum the corresponding column. 
j: Export data to a new CSV file call s_dassdata.csv
